--B.Sc Statistics (2025) Research Project

This is in partial fufillment of my research project titled: "Comparative Analysis Of Statistical and Machine Learning Models in Identifying Drivers of Urbanisation in Lagos, Nigeria."

I will be using Python as my programming language with additional Python packages to analyse and visualise my data.

The Python packages would be included in the "packages.txt" file.
